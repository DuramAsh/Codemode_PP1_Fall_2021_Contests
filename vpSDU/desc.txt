vpSDU
Kbtu has recruited a lecturer from vpSDU since there was too many freshmans this year. DasZhauren agai could not
get used to estamating system of Kbtu, so he had a lot of confusing situations. One of which was at the end of 
attestation, when he had to upload all points students earned into wsp. So he shuffled all the points between 
students. It is known that DasZhauren agai put points that way, so that i-th student had a point of (i-k)-th student.(If (i-k)<0 then we get this index of
student from the end. e.g if k = 3, n = 10, then student 1 has marks of student 8 and etc.) Then, he want to fix 
that points, but want to save as many students from retake as possible. So, the he decided to fix it like: if i-th 
student has less than 30 points at wsp, he/she gets points of (i-k)-th student(so, he gets his own points back).
If student has more than 30 points at wsp, his mark is not changing. Answer one question, could DasZhauren agai fix
that points so that no student has retake?
