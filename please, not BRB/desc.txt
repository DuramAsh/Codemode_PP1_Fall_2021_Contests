Please, not BRB.
Bauyrzhan has finished his first year as a student, and before the third course, he realized that at this semester 
he has the Russian language disciplin. He had heard about the teacher who calls herself as BRB("Bekenova Raikhan
Bulatovna"). Everyone who had this disciplin with her as a teacher tell funny, but scary stories about her subject.
Bauyrzhan wants to pick another teacher for Russian, but OR said that which teacher students get depends only on
Russian language exam, which they had passed in the start of the first semester Bauyrzhan does not remember how many
points he had got at that exam. So help him to recall it. 
The only fact about his number of points he know, that it equals to the number of minimum operations which we have 
to perform on 1 to get the reminder of the n-th fibonacci number divided by 101. Help Bauyrzhan to calculate this
number. Maximal number of points could be reached on that exam equals to 30. If Bauyrzhan realizes that he got more
than a half of these points, he get BRB as a teacher of Russian and will have a very funny semester.
Operations which we can perform are: multiply by 2, substract by 1.
If number of operations is higher than 30, then get its reminder after division by 31.
Input format:
Your are given only one number n.
Output format:
First print how many operations there was performed. Then output either "Gl hf" if he have got more than a half of 
maximal points or "Povezlo, povezlo" if he have lower points.

Input1:
5
Output1:
6
Povezlo, povezlo

Here, for example 5-th fibonacci number modulus 101 equals 5. Then, to get 5 we perform 6 operations on 1. They are:
1)1 * 2 = 2
2)2 * 2 = 4
3)4 * 2 = 8
4)8 - 1 = 7
5)7 - 1 = 6
6)6 - 1 = 5
So, as our number of operations not exceed 30, we get its value and compare with half of 30, so 15.

Input2:
10
Output2:
15
Povezlo, povezlo

Input3:
13
Output3:
6
Povezlo, povezlo

Input4:
16
Output4:
Gl hf

Input5:
14
Output5:
30
Gl hf

Input6:
50
Output6:
1
Povezlo, povezlo

Input7:
75
Output7:
21
Gl hf

Input8:
90
Output8:
Gl hf

Input9:
100
Output9:
1
Povezlo, povezlo

Input10:
66
Output10:
26
Gl hf
