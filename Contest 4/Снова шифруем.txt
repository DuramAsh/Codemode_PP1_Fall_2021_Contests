You are freshman GOPNIK and you need money, in this world money is letters. 
You meet a skinny guy who has string that consists of "0" and "1". And you don't understand what does he have, 
because you know only letters from [a-b]. There is one method that you can convert "0" and "1" 
to letters.  
The following method: looking through the sequence from left to right, 
you replaces “1” with “a”, “01” with “b”, “001” with “c”, ..., “00000000000000000000000001” with “z”. 
Write a program to help GOPNIK automate this compression method.
