The 14-th week have started. Bauyrzhan chilled all 6 weeks after his midterms and eventually end up with n firing
deadlines til the end of this week. He doesn't know from which deadline he should start, so he wants you to help him.
Write a program that will sort and print the given list of deadlines with proper priority, and then say wheter 
Bauyrzhan will have time to do them all, or not. If not print out which tasks he is not able to finish.

The proper priority will be something like that: First of all we watch to the number of days left to the deadline.
So, tasks which deadline is nearer would be placed first. Then, if number of days is equal we estimate the complexity
of this task. Thus, which task is more tough, that one will be placed first. Then, if they are also equal, just sort
in lexicographic order. (You can find out about that type of ordering from the internet, or you can ask us).
In addition, keep in mind that Bauyrzhan can do many tasks in one day, if the total sum of complexity of that tasks
does not exceed 10.

Input:Given some integer n, representing the number of deadlines Bauyrzhan have. In next n rows you have three
elements: the name of discipline, deadline day, complexity of that task.
Output.First you must print the sorted list of deadlines with proper priority. Then print either "YES", if
all deadlines are covered, or "NO", if some task could not be done. If you printed "NO" then list the subjects, 
which tasks could not be done in time.

You can think that you start from Sunday of 13-th week, and all deadline dates are in 14-th week(til the Saturday).
