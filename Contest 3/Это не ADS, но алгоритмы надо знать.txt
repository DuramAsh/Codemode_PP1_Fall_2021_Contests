Not so hard, but long solution.
We have to memorize the algorithms very well, 
so you have to write a program that will execute the algorithms n times.
Algorithms themselves will work with a vector. For each command you should use 
functions from <algorithm> library

Input format:
n - size of vector
elements of vector
m - number of commands
commands

Contraints :
all commands - sort, reverse, find_max, 
find_min, sum, kick_one, kick_part, how_many, make_bigger,
invite_one, kick_all

USE ONLY FUNCTION, EVEN PRINTING!

Output format : 
Print initial vector
Then print vector after each command
