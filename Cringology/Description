Cringology
Ibrakhim wants to congratulate all the girls of 20BD with Women’s day on 8-th of March. It would 
be easy if he was not Ibra. All of us know that Ibrakhim is well known as the head cringemaker of 20BD. 
He fed up with being known with that nickname, and in order to stop it he promised his friends to pay them 1000 
tenge for each cringe word in his speach. Probably you already understood that he is doing badly with that promise.
He is not sure about some m words that he used in his congrats if they are cringe or not. Help Ibra not to end up 
owing his friends thousands of tenge after all his congratulations. Make a program that checks Ibra’s words on 
being cringe or cringe-like.

First you are given n and m which represents the number of cringe words and number of words you must check, 
respectively. Then you have the list containing n lowercase Ibra’s cringe words. In next m lines you have lowercase 
words Ibra want to check. For these words you must determine wheter it is cringe or cringe-like. Cringe-like word is 
the word having the prefix which is a cringe word from the given list. If there was not any cringe or cringe-like 
words print out “@erla1302”. Otherwise print out “Emae, balin” and the sum he owe to his friends for all cringe in 
this congrat.
