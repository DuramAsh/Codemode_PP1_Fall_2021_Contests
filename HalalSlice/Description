Halal Slice
There is Halal Slice which stands on the path from our lovely university to Codemode 
courses. It offers 2 types of pizza(pepperoni and mushroom). Codemode students often 
go there to have something to eat before going to classes. Once, Alima decided to go there 
before the Codemode lessons. But she saw that there is a huge queue of n people since it 
was student's day. Alima's classes starts after m minutes. Help Alima to calculate if she
will be on time on her today's classes or not.

You have n pizzas placed in a stack(0 for pepperoni pizza, 1 for mushroom pizza). And there 
is also given the preferences of each person in that queue(0 if person loves pepperoni, 
and 1 if person loves mushroom pizza). If person do not find out his wished pizza on the 
top of a stack he goes to the end of our queue. Otherwise, he quits the queue. Each time
person quits or goes to the end of queue takes 1 minute.
Alima stands on the (n+1)-th position in that queue. She would like to have pepperoni pizza.
Find out will Alima get her slice of pizza or not. If yes, print "YES" and display will she 
be on time on courses or not?If she won't be on time, print out "Che opazdyvaem?". If 
she won't get her pizza, print just print out ";(".
